## Map Mock examples
Change Request **URL** and **Method**. It can be used for mapping APIs from PROD to DEV.
```go
on_request := func(env, req) {
  return {
    url: "http://127.0.0.1:8080/json",
    method: "GET"
  }
}
```

Change Request **Header** and **Query**. It can be used for debugging other developer's API.
```go
on_request := func(env, req) {
  return {
    header: {
      "Referer": "https://www.google.com/",
      "Accept-Encoding": "gzip"
    },
    query: {
      "name": "EchoProxy",
      "date": "2024-08-08"
    }
  }
}
```

Change Response **Body**. It can be used for mocking APIs for debugging and testing.
```go
on_response := func(env, res) {
  return {
    body: {
      "app": "EchoProxy",
      "comments": "Modern API debugging Proxy with powerful Map Mock",
      "date": "2024-06-30" 
    }
  }
}
```

The script changes request and response is named **EchoScript**. It is easy to learn and use.
