## Map Mock examples

Change Request **URL** and **Method**. It can be used for mapping APIs from PROD to DEV.
```go
pre_request := func() {
  return {
    url: "http://127.0.0.1:8080/json",
    method: "GET"
  }
}
```

Change Request **Header**. It can be used for debugging other developer's API.
```go
pre_request := func() {
  return {
    header: {
      "Referer": "https://www.google.com/",
      "Accept-Encoding": "gzip"
    }
  }
}
```

Change Response **Body**. It can be used for mocking APIs for debugging and testing.
```go
pre_response := func() {
  return {
    body: {
      app: "EchoProxy",
      comments: "Easy to use",
      date: "2024-06-30" 
    }
  }
}
```

The script changes request and response is named **EchoScript**. It is easy to learn and use.
