**Map Mock** is the first-class feature of EchoProxy. It is designed with love, very easy to learn and use.
It helps you to map & mock HTTP(s) request/response elegantly.

## Map Rule
The first step is to click the **Add** button creating a new **Map Rule**. There are two types of Map Rule.
> **Map Locale**: Map the HTTP(s) request to a local file, where the reponse Header & Body will be parsed from.  
> **Map Remote**: Map the HTTP(s) request to a new URL, where the reponse Header & Body will be fetched from.

### 1. Map Locale
Let's take an example to learn Map Local. The example URL is https://demo.echolabx.com/.
It's default response is:  
> **Content-Type**: text/plain; charset=utf-8  
> **Content Body**: Hi: EchoProxy

Create a Map Rule with following settings:
> MapLocale, GET, Equals, Enabled ✅  
> URL: https://demo.echolabx.com/

Set the content of **Response(Header+Body)** as following:
```json
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8

{ "msg": "success" }
```

Visit the URL https://demo.echolabx.com/ again by click refresh. You'll see the response has been changed.

> **Content-Type**: application/json; charset=UTF-8  
> **Content Body**:
```json
{ "msg": "success" }
```
