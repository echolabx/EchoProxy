How to install Certificate and debug HTTPS requests/responses on MacOS.

## Install Certificate on MacOS

In order to capture encrypted HTTPS requests/responses, 
you have to install **EchoProxy Certificate** on your current device.

You can install the EchoProxy Certificate by following the instruction
> Click **top toolbar** button <MaterialSymbolsSecurity style={inlineIcon} />
> â†’ Install Certificate on this Mac

:::note
The EchoProxy Certificate is a self-signed certificate, which is generated in your machine. 
EchoProxy never stores or transmits any personal data to EchoProxy's server or 3rd-party.
:::

:::tip
EchoProxy Certificate is stored locally at  
$HOME/Library/Application Support/com.echolabx/echoproxy
:::

### 1. Automatic mode
EchoProxy could automatically install & trust the Certificate in Keychain by following the instruction.
It's convenient for the majority of users and we can start debugging now.

### 2. Manual Mode
If automatically install failed, you can try manually install & trust EchoProxy Certificate in Keychain by following the instruction. 

<Image src={manualInstallImage} alt="Manual Install Certificate" style="border-radius:6px;" />

## Unlock HTTPS
EchoProxy uses tunnel mode for HTTPS connections by default.
You need to **Unlock HTTPS** by domain or app name to see raw request/response.

> **Prerequisite**: EchoProxy Certificate installed & trusted successfully

### 1. Quick Unlock HTTPS
You can unlock HTTPS by click button <UilLock style={inlineIcon} /> in Header/Gerneral.  
And then resend the HTTPS request, you'll see raw request/response for the domain.

### 2. HTTPS Settings dialog
You can manage all unlocked domains and apps in HTTPS Settings dialog.
> Click **top toolbar** button <UilLock style={inlineIcon} /> to open HTTPS Settings dialog.

:::note
Match type **Equals**: the request domain/app must be the same with the value.  
Match type **Contains**: the request domain/app contains the value as substring.
